1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
<br> 
2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
<br>
3 And God said, &#34;Let there be light,&#34; and there was light.
<br>
4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 
<br>
5 God called the light &#34;day,&#34; and the darkness he called &#34;night.&#34; And there was evening, and there was morning&#45;the first day.
